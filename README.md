nanoMoCo Stepper Controller/Driver
==================================

The nanoMoCo stepper driver/controller is a specialized, Arduino-compatible* device specifically designed to enable advanced multi-axis stepper-based robotics and automation projects less expensive, and easier to create.

This github contains the Eagle files, BOM, and Sketchup files for this board.  To purchase a pre-made board, see http://dynamicperception.com/products/nanomoco-stepper-drivercontroller

Key features of the nanoMoCo include:

- Atmega328P processor running at 16MHz
- 8-16V DC Operation
- Integrated A4983/A4988 bi-polar chopping driver with up to 16x microstepping
     - Up to 800 mA/coil without active cooling
     - Up to 1.5 A/coil with active cooling
- Dual opto-coupled outputs for safe interaction with other devices
- Integrated RS485 bus for multi-node communication over long distances with only two wires
- Leverage the OpenMoCo AVR Libraries and OpenMoCo Qt Libraries to create new software and applications

* requires a special USB to RS485 adapter to use with the Arduino IDE
